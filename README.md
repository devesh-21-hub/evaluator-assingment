Assingment
Please download the code of this repository in zip format.\
Extract the code into a separate folder.\
Go to that folder in your terminal.\
This project has basically two folders:

1. `client` for front-end
2. `server` for back-end

Go to both folders in separate terminal. By writing `cd client` and `cd server`
First of all start the server by going to `server` by writing `cd server` then install the dependencies and start the server by `npm i && npm run start`
Now for `client` run `npm i && npm start`. This will start the react server on `http://localhost:3000/` visit that in your browser.
Now the application is available on `http://localhost:3000/` you can test it.
Thank you!
